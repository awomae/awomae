My journey began in computer craftsmanship and gradually expanded into CCTV systems, security technologies, and solar energy solutions.
Over time, I discovered a strong passion for cybersecurity, which led me to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
In this role, I monitor and respond to security incidents, gaining hands-on experience in threat detection and analysis. 
I'm now transitioning into more specialized areas of cybersecurity, with a growing focus on web application security and digital forensics.
aiming to deepen my expertise and contribute to building safer digital environments.
